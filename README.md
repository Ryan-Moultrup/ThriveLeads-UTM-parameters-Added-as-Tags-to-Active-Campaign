# ThriveLeads: UTM parameters Added as Tags to Active Campaign

## Description 

ThriveLeads: UTM parameters Added as Tags to Active Campaign is a lightweight plugin that does exactly what it says. Grabs Google UTM parameters, if they are set, and adds them as tags to the subscriber in Active Campaign when a form is filled out. 

It's super light weight because it hooks into an existing Thrive Leads action and is able to add the UTM parameters to the data and send it on its way without interfering with the process already taking place when the form submits. There's nothing “tricky” going on to make this work. 

## Installation

All you have to do it activate the plugin and a new menu item will appear under the native WordPress Settings menu. 

## Choose Which UTM Parameters You Want Saved as Tags

On the options page choose which UTM parameters you want saved as tags when a form connected to the Active Campaign API submits. 

That's all you have to do to get it working.
